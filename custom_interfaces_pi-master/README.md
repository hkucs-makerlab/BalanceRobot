Source code for book: Custom Raspberry Pi Interfaces (ISBN 978-1-4842-2405-2)

## About this book

This book equips the reader with skills necessary to design and build
custom hardware interfaces for the Raspberry Pi. A thorough chapter on
interfacing 5-volt systems to 3.3-volt Raspberry Pis expands the
reader's choice of peripheral options. Ready to go C++ programs
involving GPIO and I2C peripherals are provided. Explores ADC, DAC,
rotary encoders, CMOS shift registers, I2C I/O extenders.  

Readers will discover low cost display and sensor options for embedded
system projects. Master I2C communications using Raspbian Linux in C++.
Perform ADC and DAC experiments. Debounce buttons and switches using
hardware and software solutions. Read rotary encoders for direction and
step. Develop flywheel rotary encoder effects for ease of tuning.
Construct a hardware interface to the Music Playing Daemon (MPD) with
developed software. Discover how to add your own hardware keypad for
remote combination lock applications.

## What you'll learn:

- Build simple, low cost input/output interfaces including rotary encoders 
- Interface 5-volt devices from a 3-volt Raspberry Pi system 
- Conquer stuttering buttons and switches through hardware and software debouncing 
- Apply analog to digital and digital to analog conversions on the Pi 
- Read potentiometers (volume control) from the Pi 
- Determine step, direction, and velocity of a rotary encoder 
- Provide your own hardware devices for embedded applications
- Work with external CMOS devices like the 74HC595 (using C++)
- Perform remote interfacing using the I2C PCF8574 peripheral chip

## Who this book is for:

Students and hobbyists interested in building custom interfaces for their Raspberry Pis.
